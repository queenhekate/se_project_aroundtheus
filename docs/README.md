**Intro**
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. WHTML, CSS Flexbox, Grid properties, pseudo classes and media queries are artfully sewn together to create a dynamic interactive website that works on a variety of screen resolutions.

**Figma**

The project was developed using a Figma file as a reference. Utilizing Figma maintained the integrity of the desiger's original intent. Converting designer specifications into a functional website was a straightforward process with the use of Figma.
