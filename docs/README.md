## ✨ Project Intent

This responsive web experience was crafted to adapt beautifully across devices, from mobile to desktop.  
With a blend of HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox, pseudo-classes, and media queries, the site creates a clean, interactive journey that honors both design and functionality.

## 🎨 Design Process

The site was developed using a Figma design file as reference.  
Translating the designer's static elements into responsive, living code was a joyful challenge—one that sharpened my attention to detail and deepened my front-end skills.
