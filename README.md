## ✨ Project Intent

This responsive web experience was crafted to adapt beautifully across devices, from mobile to desktop.  
With a blend of HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox, pseudo-classes, and media queries, the site creates a clean, interactive journey that honors both design and functionality.

## 🎨 Design Process

The site was developed using a Figma design file as reference.  
Translating the designer's static elements into responsive, living code was a joyful challenge—one that sharpened my attention to detail and deepened my front-end skills.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

This was my first project incorporating **JavaScript** and working with an **API**—a real turning point in my development journey. Learning to make asynchronous calls and manipulate the DOM opened up a new sense of possibility. I began to see how logic, design, and interactivity could work together to tell a story.

Some takeaways:

- **Working with APIs** taught me how data flows and how to handle it with care—especially when users are waiting on the other end.
- **JavaScript** gave me a glimpse of how alive a website can feel. I now see code as a tool not just for function, but for expression.
- **Debugging** stretched my patience but strengthened my confidence. I began to see bugs as invitations, not failures.
- **Design fidelity** from Figma reinforced the importance of honoring details while still allowing room for creativity.

This project reminded me why I’m here: to build with empathy, stay curious, and keep learning out loud.
